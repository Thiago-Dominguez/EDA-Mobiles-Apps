# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the Dataset "Mobile Apps"

I have done an analysis on this dataset about mobile app usage. For data manipulation I used Python with Jupiter, in Visual Code. I got the dataset from Kaggle. It is a general average of daily mobile app usage during the 30 days of August, 2024.

## Repository content

- **`Mobile_Apps.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis of the "Mobile Apps" dataset.
- **`screentime_analysis.csv`**: The dataset "screentime_analysis" used for analysis.

## How to use this git repository? 
   
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook or run the script to explore the analysis.
